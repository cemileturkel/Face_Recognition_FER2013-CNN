# Face_Recognition_FER2013-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face and emotion recognition with the FER2013 dataset. The model classifies facial expressions into seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral, using deep learning techniques to enhance accuracy and performance.
